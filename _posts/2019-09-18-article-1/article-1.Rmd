| General topic?                 | The ice that floated on oceans decreasing the melting of Antarctic ice , are disappearing due to the heating of oceans |
| Procedure / what was examined? | Researchers observed ice blocks from oceans                                                                            |
| Conclusion                     | Climate change induces warming of oceans and this increases, the melting of Antarctic's glaciers                       |
| Remaining questions            | How much exactly destruction of ice shelves impacts on environment?                                                    |

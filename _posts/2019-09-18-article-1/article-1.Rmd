| General topic       | This topic talk about  how warmer ocean water creates melt of the Antarctica's glaciers |
| What was examined ? | degradation of layer of ice                                                             |
| Conclusion          | we must rapidly find any process which can remove a glacier                             |
| Remaining questions | how much melty of the glaciers increase temperature and sea-level                       |

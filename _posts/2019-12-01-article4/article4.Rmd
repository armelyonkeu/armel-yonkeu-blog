| General topic ?                 | In this article, we talk about the discovery and the 3D reconstruction of prehistoric civilization buried in the north sea due to, the increase in the melting of ice which caused increase in water level of said sea. |
| Procedure / what was examined ? |  The team had planned to exploit the DNA found on the stones and other relics in order to reconstruct a 3D map by special techniques                                                                                    |
| Conclusions / discovery         | This article makes us understand that melting of ice has taken place a long time ago. We could ask ourselves the question of whether global warming has a preponderant place in the melting of ice?                     |

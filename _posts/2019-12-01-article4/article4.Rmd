| General topic ?                 | This article talk about an exploration of Doggerland  by scientits using two methods to have more informations about mesolitic human                                                                      |
| Procedure / what was examined ? | Scientits created 3D map of colorado-size plot of Doggerland and took core samples from the sea floor by using specialized ship                                                                 |
| Conclusion / discovery ?        | 3D map had revealed Doggerland's hill, rivers and coats. Scientits hope to find human relics and sources of plant and animal DNA which can reveal a ecosystem                                                    |

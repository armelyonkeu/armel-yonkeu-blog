| General topic ?                | In this article, researchers discovered 28 frozen viruses in ice cores                                                                                                      |
| Procedure / what was examined? | The challenge was to analyze viruses without any contamination, so researchers put ice cores in cold room, then they cut and washed them twice                              |
| Conclusions                    | Knowing that the melting of glaciers will continue it is important to know viruses they contain so that researchers will be  able to provide solutions in case of infection |
| Remaining questions            | Are this new viruses impacting groups of microbes?                                                                                                                          |
